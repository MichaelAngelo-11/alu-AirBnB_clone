# AirBnB Clone - The Console



The AirBnB clone project is in its early stages. Building a command-line interpreter that controls backend objects, such as people, locations, cities, and more, is the aim.



Basic functions including creating, updating, removing, and displaying items will be supported by the console. Future developments, such as database integration, web interfaces, and RESTful APIs, will be built upon it.
